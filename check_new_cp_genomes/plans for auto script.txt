plans for auto script:

1. cd Documents/Python_files/research_scripts/GenBank_scripts/check_new_cp_genomes/
2. python Plastid_Program.py

once a month as soon as awake: If get error message (connection) wait 24 hours and do again

Better to run with path in command but then edit program so the three files are specified with a path. Need to find out about this

Also - work on email program that can be used as a module anywhere (set path?)
use either setup tools (http://click.pocoo.org/5/setuptools/) or look here:
http://intermediate-and-advanced-software-carpentry.readthedocs.org/en/latest/structuring-python.html and try PYTHONPATH and easy_install

setuptools working nicely (see /Users/Paul13/Documents/Python_files/research_scripts/GenBank_scripts/check_new_cp_genomes/example_email_scripts_setuptools) or example on old mac 11 inch.

AGAIN - what happens when get new computer. How best to keep track of all setup files and rue them when get new laptop and python?



Next steps:

automate to do once per month (not critical): launchd or cron tabs
see bookmarked pages under shell.

IMPORTANT: What happens to these plists when update computer. Keep list of customs plists somewhere!

Add a separate search that looks through ALL genbank accessions and finds ones that are:
Match “moniliformopses”
Not already in list
Greater than 80,000 bp
Has at least one one the following words: “chloroplast”, “plastid” ,“plastome”, "


automatic email

deals with connection error and tries again in 24 hours?
