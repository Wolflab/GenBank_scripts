Friends: I have updated the list of complete plastid genomes of ferns that I have detected in GenBank. Updated csv file attached.
 
Also included are fragments over 10 kb.

Please contact me if you wish:

to be removed from this list
your email address changed
you know of other GenBank entires that I should add
you know of other projects in progress that should be added to the list
you know of colleagues who might want to be added to this update list

Thanks

Paul
